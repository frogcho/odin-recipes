        </p>
        <h5><b>Ingredients</b></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 packages (40g each) of active, dry yeast</li>
            <li>1-1/4 cups warm water (45 - 50 degrees Celsius)</li>
            <li>1 cup <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/sourdough-starter/"> sourdough starter</a> </li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 to 6-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>Melted butter</li>
            <li>Butterknife</li>
        </ul>
        <h5><b>Instructions</b></h5>
        <ol>
           <li>Ensure your sourdough starter is fed for about a week</li>
           <li>Dissolve two packets of active dry yeast in warm water</li>
           <li>Give mixture quick whisk and add the sourdough starter (this should create a foamy, rich-smelling mixture)</li>
           <li>Add in the eggs, sugar, oil, salt and three cups of flour and mix until smooth (stand mixer with dough hook makes this step much easier!)</li>
           <li>Add in the remaining flour to make a dough</li>
           <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (you can do this by hand or continue to use your stand mixer)</li>
           <li>Move the dough to a greased bowl and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour</li>
           <li>Deflate the dough, lightly flour a surface (your kitchen bench works great!) and turn the dough onto it</li>
           <li>Start with a larger chunk of dough and shape it into an oval to form the frog's body</li>
           <li>Add two back legs and two front legs (along with feet) using smaller pieces of dough</li>
           <li>Roll two small balls and stick them on top of your “frog” to create the eyes</li>
           <li>Don't forget to carve a smile with a butterknife!</li>
           <li>Brush the frog bread with an egg wash, then bake it at 180 degrees celsius for about 45 minutes or until golden brown</li>
           <li>Eat bread!</li>
        </ol>
